# 206. Reverse Linked List
- Easy | Linked List, Recursion
- [Reverse Linked List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

## Problem Description
Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
 
For example, <br>
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:
1. The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
2. -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 
## Approach
### 1 - Iterative Method
I thought the iterative method could be more intutive. We can use three pointers: `prev`, `curr` and `next` to reverse the linked list:
we use 'prev' to store the new linked list (initialize it `=None` since the last of the linked list is None, and initialize `curr = head` to do the iteration:
1. while `curr` still has elements, store the next node of `curr` to `next_node` (e.g. 1st iteration: curr = 1, next_node = 2)
2. reverse the linked list by set `curr.next` to `prev` (e.g. `curr.next = None`, that is 1 -> None)
3. Move `prev` to `curr` and `curr` to `next_node` (e.g. prev = 1, curr = 2)
After the iteration, we got the new reversed linked list

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        prev = None
        curr = head

        while curr:
            next_node = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_node
        
        return prev
```
The solution beats 71.3% in Runtime and 43.9% in Memory

## Complexity Analysis
### 1 - Iterative Method
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Notes
It is a relatively basic problem that only requires careful consideration of the relationship among the current node, next node, and previous node. It is important to set the order of changing the pointers correctly. The iterative method is an efficient approach for this problem.
