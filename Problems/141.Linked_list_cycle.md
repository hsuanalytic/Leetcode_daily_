# 141. Linked List Cycle
- Easy | Hash Table, Linked List, Two Pointers
- [Linked List Cycle - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

## Problem Description
Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
 
For example, <br>
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed)
```

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list
```

Constraints:
1. The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
2. -105 <= Node.val <= 105
3. pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.

## Approach
### 1 - Hash Set Approach
The solution is quite straightforward. We build a set to store the node we've visited, and we move the pointer to the next node and see if the node already visited. (That is, forming a cycle)

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        # Edge cases: no element/one element
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False

        visited = set()

        while head:
            visited.add(head)
            head = head.next
            if head in visited:
                return True
        return False
```
The solution beats 9.7% in Runtime and 9.7% in Memory

### 2 - Two Pointers Approach (Fast-slow pointers)
I personally think the approach is clever. First, we use two pointers (fast and slow) to traverse the linked list. Fast pointer move 2 steps/time, and slow pointer move 1 step instead.
If the linked list is a cycle, there must be a moment that fast pointer meet slow pointer. Otherwise, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list(The last element or None)

```python
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False

        slow = head
        fast = head.next

        while slow != fast:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return True
```
The solution beats 22.9% in Runtime and 43.3% in Memory

## Complexity Analysis
### 1 - Hash Set Approach
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(N)

### 2 - Two Pointers Approach (Fast-slow pointers)
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Notes
The problem requires detecting cycles in a linked list. Both the hash set approach and the two-pointer approach provide effective solutions. I personally prefer to use two pointers approach which might be more efficient.
