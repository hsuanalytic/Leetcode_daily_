# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

## Problem Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day. <br>
You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. <br>
Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

For example, <br>
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

Constraints:
1. 1 <= `prices.length` <= 105
2. 0 <= `prices[i]` <= 104
 
## Understanding (I/O, Constraints)
The problem aim to find the best time to buy and sell stock such that maximize the profit. The solution should return **int** value represent the max profit (Sell price - Buy price). If there is no transaction happened(like ex.2), just return 0.
The `prices` array has at least 1 element and at most 105 elements, with each element ranged from 0 to 104.

## Approach
### 1 - Brute Force Approach [FAIL - TLE]
Almost all problems could be solved in the most straightforward brute force approach. We could easily iterate over all elements in the array `prices`.
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        profit = 0
        for buy in range(len(prices)):
            for sell in range(buy+1, len(prices)):
                profit = max(prices[sell] - prices[buy], profit)
        return profit
```
The approach failed dut to the Time Limited Error (TLE)
