# 53. Maximum Subarray
- Medium | Array, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming
- [Maximum Subarray - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.<br>
(A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.)
 
For example, <br>
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
```

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
```

Constraints:
1. 1 <= nums.length <= 105
2. -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 
## Approach
### 1 - Kadane's Algorithm
The Kadane's Algorithm could be efficient in the maximum subarray problems. It basically equal to Dynamic Programming. The algorithm contain two variables: `current sum` and `max sum`, and implement as the following steps:
1. If `current sum` + new number > new number -> add new number to `current sum`, otherwise, we abandon `current sum` and restart with the new number
2. Comparing `current sum` with `max sum` and update `max sum` to get the maximum.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            current_sum = max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        return max_sum
```
The solution beats 33.1% in Runtime and 99.4% in Memory

## Complexity Analysis
### 1 - Kadane's Algorithm
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Notes
I first solve it with Brute Force approach and then notice this algorithm, which is much more efficient and useful in solving this kind of problems. But I still have some questions about the algorithm, why it compare current sum + new number with new number instead of comparing with current sum (My intuition is to see if adding new number will increase the sum so we compare old sum with new sum to see if it's established). Trying to figure out recently.
