# 53. Maximum Subarray
- Medium | Array, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming
- [Maximum Subarray - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

## Problem Description
Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum.<br>
(A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.)
 
For example, <br>
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
```

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The subarray [1] has the largest sum 1.
```

Constraints:
1. 1 <= nums.length <= 105
2. -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 
## Approach
### 1 - Kadane's Algorithm
The Kadane's Algorithm could be efficient in the maximum subarray problems. It basically equal to Dynamic Programming. The algorithm contain two variables: `current sum` and `max sum`, and implement as the following steps:
1. If `current sum` + new number > new number itself -> add new number to `current sum`, otherwise, we update `current sum` that start with the new number
2. Comparing `current sum` with `max sum` and update `max sum` to get the maximum

```python
class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            current_sum = max(nums[i], current_sum + nums[i])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
        return max_sum
```
The solution beats 33.1% in Runtime and 99.4% in Memory

### 1 - Kadane's Algorithm
- Time Complexity: O(N)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## Notes
Kadane's Algorithm is an efficient approach for solving the maximum subarray problems. The algorithm compares the sum of the current subarray with the new number to determine whether to include the new number in the subarray or start a new subarray. (While I still have some questions about the Kadane's Algorithm, when I get more familiar with it, I will update here.)
