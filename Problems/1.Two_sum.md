# 1. Two Sum
[Two Sum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. <br>
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. <br>
You can return the answer in any order.

For example, <br>
```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Constraints:
1. 2 <= nums.length <= 104
2. -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
3. -109 <= target <= 109
4. Only one valid answer exists.
 
## Understanding
The problem requires finding two numbers in the given `nums` array that add up to the `target` value. The solution should return the **indices** of these two numbers.

The problem assumes that there is always **EXACTLY ONE** valid solution, and the same element cannot be used twice. The order of the returned indices does not matter.

The problem also provides the range of each variable, giving a better understanding of the input constraints. The `nums` will have at least 2 elements and at most 104 elements, with each element is within the range of -109 to 109. Besides, the `target` value will also fall within the range -109 to 109.
